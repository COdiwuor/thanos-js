# thanos-js

Thanos has now arrived on your PC and he will bring havoc to your files.

He will wipe out about one third of your files if he snaps fingers without gauntlet.
And If he has the gauntlet, he will crush about half of them.

You are lucky though, he can only carry out destruction in the directory in which the command is executed.

## Install:

`npm install -g thanos-js`

## Usage:

-   Limited Power: `thanos-js snap-fingers`
-   Full Power: `thanos-js snap-fingers --with-infinity-gauntlet-glove`
